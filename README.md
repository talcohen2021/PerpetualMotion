# PerpetualMotion
Card game gui in Python using tkinter

Objective: to get the cards from 2-10 in order per suit from left to right
Rules: 
  Any two may be moved to an available gap on the left hand side, if more than one is available you will be given a choice.
  Nothing may be placed after a 10
  You can only move the card that follows into a gap - i.e only the 5 of diamonds can be moved into a gap following the 4 of diamonds.
  There are two options to shuffle the cards, a shuffle can not be undone.
  When you shuffle the cards that are in order from the left starting with a two in the leftmost position will remain in place during a shuffle.

  Enjoy.
